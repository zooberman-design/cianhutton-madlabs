"Heya, how's it going? I’m Cian and was just curious about the club and had a few q’s if you don’t mind answering :) 1. What sessions take place each week with the club - days/times/location. 2. Is there anything that you need from a new participant before their first session (do they need to book/ pay ahead of time)? 3. Where is the best place for new members to contact you (IG/email/phone number) and lastly 4. Do you offer any free taster sessions? That’s it! I’m starting up a non-profit and in the middle of developing a website - I’ve been trying to get a picture of sports participation within the adult community so really appreciate you taking the time to provide some additional info around the club! A follow would be much appreciated too (so at least it makes it LOOK like I know what I’m doing)!",,,,,"Hi there, I’m Cian - a  sports science student and I’m working on a dissertation to do with the impact of the availability of clubs such as yours on mental health and would really appreciate it if you took the time to answer my questions. I have made this questionnaire entirely confidential and these results will be used for a study that will hopefully shine a light on our community sports! Thanks for taking the time to answer. Thanks and have a good day :)",https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJNoHVnaz8rtq4A-50aecZds0xEep1GttB9o5G9rKLr5d-ug/viewform?usp=dialog,,,,,,,,,,,,,,St.,Fin.,St.,Fin.,St.,Fin.,St.,Fin.,St.,Fin.,St.,Fin.,St.,Fin.,,,
